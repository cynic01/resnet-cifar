# Train ResNet-18 model on CIFAR10 Dataset

To run all experiments, execute:
```
python3 lab2.py
```

In `lab2.py`, the code to run each experiment is a function (e.g. `c5()`, `q3()`). You can selectively enable or disable running them by commenting out lines 64-70.

File `resnet18.py` contains the model definition, while `train.py` contains the training and performance measurement code.
